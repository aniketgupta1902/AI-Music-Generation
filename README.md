# MUSIC-GENERATION
Music generation is one of the interesting applications of machine learning. As music itself is sequential data, it can be modelled using a sequential machine learning model such as the recurrent neural network. This modelling can help in learning the music sequence and generating the sequence of music data.
 - This is a machine learning and deep learning based project using CNN and LSTM Model.
 - This can be used to generate new notes/chords randomly every time after training on music data.
 - Feel free to contribute!
